# ecommerce-SQL-Project
In this project, I leveraged SQL to conduct an in-depth analysis of e-commerce sales data. My primary objectives were to analyze and identify the stores with the highest and lowest sales figures. However, I didn't stop there. I went further to explore and evaluate the performance of various departments within those stores. Moreover, I delved into the potential influence of key variables such as unemployment rates, temperature, fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), and holiday seasons on sales.



   
 ### Query types used:
- count(distinct)
- Create table
- Create table #
- Insert into
- min/max
- SUM
- AVG
- ROUND
- Where between
- Joins
- CTEs
- Case statement
- Group by

By examining these multiple factors, I aimed to gain comprehensive insights into the sales patterns and dynamics of the e-commerce business. This project showcases my proficiency in SQL and demonstrates my ability to perform advanced analysis to uncover valuable correlations and trends.
