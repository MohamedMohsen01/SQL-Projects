# ecommerce-SQL-Project
In this project, I leveraged SQL to conduct an in-depth analysis of e-commerce sales data. My primary objectives were to analyze and identify the stores with the highest and lowest sales figures. However, I didn't stop there. I went further to explore and evaluate the performance of various departments within those stores. Moreover, I delved into the potential influence of key variables such as unemployment rates, temperature, fuel prices, consumer price index (CPI), and holiday seasons on sales.
