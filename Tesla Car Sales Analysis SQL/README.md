## Introduction
The purpose of this analysis is to gain valuable insights and patterns within Tesla car sales data. By thoroughly examining sales data across various regions, products, and time frames, we aim to identify top-performing products, high-performing regions, and the most profitable time periods. These findings will help optimize our sales strategies and enhance overall performance to drive substantial revenue growth.



## Data Description

The dataset used in this analysis was obtained from the Kaggle website and contains 924 rows and 7 columns. The columns include Model, Period, Country, Purchase_type, Version, Price, and Gross_Profit, providing comprehensive information about the cars sold by the company.

**Data Dictionary:**

The dataset consists of 7 columns with their corresponding data types:

| Column Name                | Column Datatype |
| :------------------------- | :-------------: |
| Model                      |  VARCHAR(50)    |
| Period                     |     DATE        |
| Country                    |  VARCHAR(50)    |
| Purchase_type              |  VARCHAR(50)    |
| Version                    |  VARCHAR(50)    |
| Price                      |  DECIMAL(10,3)  |
| Gross_Profit               |  DECIMAL(10,3)  |




## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
  - The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from the Kaggle website.

3. **Data Understanding:**

 - Explored the dataset's structure, available columns, data types, and the data dictionary to understand its contents and objectives.

3. **Data Assessment:** 
  - Thorough data quality assessment was conducted, addressing missing values, outliers, inconsistent formatting, and data entry errors.

4. **Data Cleaning and Data Validation:**

 Several tasks were performed to ensure the data was in a usable and reliable format. Here are some key steps I took:
   - Cleaned the data in Excel and adjusted the date format.
   - Added constraints in Microsoft SQL Server, like a `Primary Key` for uniqueness and data integrity.
   - Chose appropriate `data types` for accurate storage and manipulation of data.
   - Enforced `NOT NULL` constraints on relevant columns to ensure data completeness and prevent the insertion of null values.
 
 5. **Feature Engineering**
   - A new column called `month` was created to extract the corresponding month of each transaction, aiding in identifying months with the highest sales and profitability.
